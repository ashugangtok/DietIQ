## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Moderate blue (#5B8DAE), chosen for its association with data, insights, and clarity. It strikes a balance between being professional and approachable.
- Background color: Light grayish-blue (#E8EDF0) â€” a very desaturated near-tint of the primary, provides a clean and unobtrusive backdrop that keeps the focus on the data.
- Accent color: Soft purple (#9163A4), an analogous color that adds a touch of sophistication, creativity and interest.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif), used for its readability and modern appearance, ensuring clarity of data display.
- Use a clean, tabular layout for displaying the data. Ensure responsiveness for different screen sizes. Provide clear visual separation between data entries.
- Implement subtle transition animations when filtering or updating data in the table.
